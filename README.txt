The structure of the directory is the following:

- Data: contains the files for each of the datasets used

- Results: this directory was created to store the rules generated by the algorithm and the
results obtained in each iteration.

-Source: this directory contains all the classes that implement the algorithm and each of
the experiments.
	– Utils: contains extra functionalities that help to read datasets and write results.
	– Prism: contains the class which implements the main PRISM algorithm.
	– Rule: contains the class which implements each of the rules generated by the model.

- Main: is the main file to be run to start the experiments.

- Venv: contains the files that make up the execution environment.

- Requirements: This file was created to facilitate the installation of necessary libraries.

Although the project was built using Python 3.10, it should also work with any python3 version. 
You can find all the necessary dependencies in the requirements.txt file located in the root 
directory of the project. The following execution steps has been tested both in Windows and Linux terminal:

1. Open the project folder in the terminal.

2. Create virtual environment:

> python3 -m venv venv/
> source venv/bin/activate
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

* sudo apt-get install python3.8 venv (for installing the venv package in a determined python version)

3. Execute an experiment:

> python3 main.py -d DATASET -n #ITERATIONS -s RESULT_FOLDER

Possible values for this attributes are:
	- DATASET: hayes-roth, balance-scale and kr-vs-kp.
	- #ITERATIONS: [1-inf)
	- RESULT-FOLDER: any existing directory inside the root directory.

i.e.) python3 main.py -d balance-scale -n 10 -s results/
